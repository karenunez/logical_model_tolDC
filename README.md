# logical_model_tolDC

Logical model of tolerogenic dendritic cells from human monocytes.

In this repository, you can find the model archive, the CoLoMoTo notebook with further analyses, and the supplementary files of the manuscript.

The CoLoMoTo notebook results can be reproduced within the CoLoMoTo Docker image following the instructions provided in the [link](https://colomoto.github.io/colomoto-docker/); in brief, go to [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/colomoto/colomoto-docker/mybinder/latest), then upload the notebook (tolorezation_IL10.ipynb) and the model (model_tolerization_IL10.zginml) in mybinder, then start the notebook and run it.
